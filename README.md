# WIFI-Controlled-Robocar
This project focuses on creating an intelligent two-wheel robotic system that can be controlled remotely and utilizes ultrasonic sensors for navigation and obstacle detection.

## Features

- **Remote Control:** Control the UltrabotX wirelessly using Blynk app.
- **Ultrasonic Sensing:** Utilize ultrasonic sensors to measure distances and navigate around obstacles/stops if the distance is less than 40cm and reverses.
- **Motor Control:** Drive the robot with precise motor control for forward, backward, left, and right movements.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Receive real-time distance feedback from the ultrasonic sensors for effective navigation.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico 
- Two-wheeled robotic chassis with motor driver
- Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04 or similar)
- WiFi connectivity for remote control
- Thonny IDE
